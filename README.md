# Master graduate results
========================

This project is used to generate results to my thesis work.

collect.py file read text files with information about consumed resources retrieved on each algorithm execution. Also read prediction images and apply Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 e IoU metrics on GT "mestrado" dataset and summarize these results.

results folder contains prediction images obtained from follow projects:

https://github.com/zisluiz/RGBD-object-propsal

https://github.com/zisluiz/JCSA_RM_Image_Seg

https://github.com/zisluiz/graph-canny-segm / https://github.com/zisluiz/obeach

https://github.com/zisluiz/fusenet-pytorch

https://github.com/zisluiz/RedNet

https://github.com/zisluiz/FCN.tensorflow

## Metrics are obtained from follow works:
https://github.com/GeorgeSeif/Semantic-Segmentation-Suite/blob/master/utils/utils.py

https://github.com/chainer/chainercv/blob/master/chainercv/evaluations/eval_semantic_segmentation.py

and https://scikit-image.org/ library. 


Results obtained will be public available soon.
