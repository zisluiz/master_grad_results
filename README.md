# master_grad_results
========================

This project is used to generate results to my thesis work.

collect.py file read text files with information about consumed resources retrieved on each algorithm execution. Also read prediction images and apply Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 e IoU metrics on GT "mestrado" dataset and summarize these results.

results folder contains prediction images obtained from follow projects:
https://github.com/zisluiz/RGBD-object-propsal
https://github.com/zisluiz/JCSA_RM_Image_Seg
https://github.com/zisluiz/graph-canny-segm / https://github.com/zisluiz/obeach
https://github.com/zisluiz/fusenet-pytorch
https://github.com/zisluiz/RedNet
https://github.com/zisluiz/FCN.tensorflow

Results obtained will be public available soon.
